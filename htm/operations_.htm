<h1>Operations Guide</h1>

<p>The manipulator is operated using the <a href="../../pro_4/html/controller_manip.html"> hand controller</a>.</p>

<p>The manipulator can be rotated out of the water so the jaws can open vertically, horizontally or at an arbitrary angle.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_tip.png"> Depending upon the requirements, rotate the manipulator to be best suited gripping the intended object depending on whether the objects orientation is horizontal or vertical.</p>

<img src="../../required/images/icon_tip.png"> If the manipulator is in the fully vertical orientation it will be difficult to see how much it is open or closed.  It is often best to offset the jaws at a slight angle so that you can see both jaws from the camera.</p>
